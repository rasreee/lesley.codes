## ðŸŒ™ Implementation Walkthrough

Review the tutorial instructions [here](http://localhost:3000/blog/build-a-cmd-k-search-modal-1) if you need to, but I'm going to dive straight into the tutorial and explain my solution as best as possible.

Before coding anything, we should take a brief moment to get a better understanding of the architecture we want the implementation to take, keeping in mind that this may change as throughout development and doesn't have to be absolutely perfect from the start. In the real world, the most important thing is to ship features to users as fast as possible - something that can be easy to forget as a Software Engineer.

We can outline an example the of UI flow, specifically the expected sequence of user inputs and outputs.

Here's a somewhat end-to-end example where the user gets non-empty search results for their query:

1. The search modal is in its default state (hidden).
2. Bob clicks the "Quick search" button.
3. The search modal is visible, and the top input field is automatically focused.
4. Bob types "doge" into the input field.
5. Bob sees a list of search results for his query.
6. Bob clicks the first search hit for "doge".
7. The search modal is hidden, and the app navigates Bob to the search hit's URL.

<NotionAside>
  It's useful to write UI flow examples not only because it helps you understand the scenarios
  better, but also because you can then use it with a behavior-driven testing tool like
  [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) to write tests.
</NotionAside>

Let's write another example where the user gets no results for their query.

1. The search modal is in its default state (hidden).
2. Bob clicks the "Quick search" button.
3. The search modal is visible, and the top input field is automatically focused.
4. Bob types "asdf" into the input field.
5. The search modal shows "No results found for 'asdf'".
6. Bob presses the Escape key.
7. The search modal is hidden.

Later, we will exchange Step 2 for both example flows with the pressing of âŒ˜K to test for the hotkey implementation for opening the search modal, but for now let's ignore that to keep things focused and simple.

### ðŸ¥ž Generic Modal Component

Let's implement a generic Modal component which will be used by SearchModal to wrap its children.

The Modal component should take care of the basic functionality of modals:

1. It should render its children as its content (i.e. via a `children` prop)
2. It should should notify whichever component is using it of when the modal should be closed, namely: (1) when the user clicks outside of it and (2) when the user presses the Escape key (i.e. via an `onClose` handler prop).
3. Clients of the Modal should be able to tell the Modal whether to show or hide its children (i.e. via an `isOpen` boolean prop).

Based on the above requirements, here's a basic typescript definition for its props:

```ts
interface ModalProps {
  /**
   * Indicates whether modal is visible or not
   */
  isOpen: boolean;
  /**
   * Handler to call when modal should be closed
   */
  onClose: () => void;
  /**
   * Children of modal
   */
  children: ReactNode;
}
```

... and here's the initial implementation of the React component:

```tsx
export const Modal: FC<ModalProps> = ({ isOpen, onClose, children }) => {
  if (!isOpen) return null;

  return <div>{children}</div>;
};
```

### ðŸ¥ž SearchModal

Let's create another component that uses Modal called SearchModal. SearchModal can just require the same props as ModalProps except for children.

```tsx
type SearchModalProps = Omit<ModalProps, 'children'>;

const SearchModal = (props: SearchModalProps) => {
  return (
    <Modal {...props}>
      <h1>Search Modal</h1>
    </Modal>
  );
};
```

Now, we can render SearchModal as one of the children for SearchModalProvider, like so:

```tsx
<SearchModalContext.Provider value={{ isOpen, open, close }}>
  {children}
  <SearchModal isOpen={isOpen} onClose={close} />
</SearchModalContext.Provider>
```

SearchModalProvider will now handle rendering of the search modal based on its visibility state.

### ðŸ¥ž Modal: Basic Functionality

Let's implement some more basic functionality for the Modal before moving onto the Search-related components.

We want the Modal to be hidden when the user clicks outside of the modal while it is open. We can do this easily with react hooks and refs.
There are various NPM packages to choose from to listen to "click outside" DOM events using React hooks. My current favorite package for this is the @react-hookz/web package due to its bundle size and extensibility.
Feel free to install it or fork its implementation like I did by taking the necessary source code for the useClickOutside hook.

Add the following logic to the Modal:

```tsx
const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null);

useClickOutside(ref, onClose);

return <div ref={ref}>{children}</div>;
```

Make sure and test whether clicking outside the opened Modal component triggers the modal hidden. Before moving on.

Finally, we want the modal to be hidden when pressing the Escape key. We can follow a similar approach as before with a useKeyPress hook which wraps @react-hookz/web's useKeyboardEvent hook and listens for a given keyboard events.

```ts
export enum EventKeys {
  ARROW_DOWN = 'ArrowDown',
  ARROW_UP = 'ArrowUp',
  ARROW_RIGHT = 'ArrowRight',
  ENTER = 'Enter',
  SPACE = 'Space',
  TAB = 'Tab',
  BACKSPACE = 'Backspace',
  CONTROL = 'Control',
  META = 'Meta',
  HOME = 'Home',
  END = 'End',
  PAGE_DOWN = 'PageDown',
  DELETE = 'Delete',
  ESCAPE = 'Escape',
  SHIFT = 'Shift'
}

export function useKeyPress(key: EventKeys, callback: () => void) {
  useKeyboardEvent(
    true,
    (e) => {
      // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-expressions
      e.key === key && callback();
    },
    [],
    {
      eventOptions: {
        passive: true
      }
    }
  );
}
```

The EventKeys enum can be imported by the useKeyPress's client to make sure the correct key event is specified, like so:

```ts
useKeyPress(EventKeys.ESCAPE, onClose);
```

(You can add this to our Modal component to wrap up this section).

### ðŸ¥ž Modal: Basic Styling

Let's add some basic styling to the Modal component using Emotion. I recommend referring to Emotion's documentation if you aren't familiar with styled JSX syntax. If you have used Styled Components before, styling with Emotion should feel straightforward.

One common practice when using a styling framework like Emotion/Styled Components is to keep all the styles in one file and the React component in another where those styles will be imported.

Here's how I did it:

```tsx
import * as S from './styles';

export const Modal: FC<ModalProps> = ({ isOpen, onClose, children }) => {
  return (
    <S.Backdrop>
      <S.Container ref={ref}>{children}</S.Container>
    </S.Backdrop>
  );
};
```

### ðŸ¥ž âŒ˜K Hotkey

Let's implement the hotkey logic for opening the modal when âŒ˜K is pressed by creating a new hook called useKeyCombo to listen for sequences of keyboard events.

```ts
export function useKeyCombo(combo: (EventKeys | string)[], callback: () => void) {
  const [keysPressed, setKeysPressed] = useState<string[]>([]);

  const pressedCombo = useMemo(
    () => (keysPressed.length ? keysPressed.join('+') : ''),
    [keysPressed]
  );

  useKeyboardEvent(
    true,
    (e) => {
      setKeysPressed((prev) => prev.slice(-5).concat([e.key]));
    },
    [],
    {
      eventOptions: {
        passive: true
      }
    }
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    if (pressedCombo.includes(combo.join('+'))) {
      callback();
      setKeysPressed([]);
    }
  }, [keysPressed]);
}
```

Then we can use the hook in SearchModal like so:

```ts
useKeyCombo([EventKeys.META, 'k'], onClose);
```

Now all that's left is the core search functionality for when the modal is visible.

## ðŸŒ™ SearchModal: Composition

Let's scaffold the search bar and search dropdown components within SearchModal.
SearchBar will render the input field UI, and SearchResults will render the search results UI.

Compose SearchModal with these two components like so:

```tsx
<Modal {...props}>
  <SearchBar query={query} onQueryChange={setQuery} />
  <SearchResults data={mockSearchResultDatas} />
</Modal>
```

### ðŸ¥ž SearchBar

#### Input Autofocus

Let's make the input field autofocus upon mounting. Again, we can utilize React hooks in combination with a ref instance for the input HTML element, like so:

```ts
/* Ref to pass to input element */
const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement | null>(null);

/* Auto-focus input upon mounting */
useEffect(() => {
  inputRef.current?.focus();
}, []);
```

### ðŸ¥ž SearchResults

#### Data Model

At some point we will want to know what the data looks like for the search results. Let's define a typescript interface that represents the data for a search hit:

```ts
export interface SearchResultData {
  /* Unique integer ID */
  id: number;
  /* Title for the search hit to present to the user */
  title: string;
  /* sourceUrl of the search hit relative to the client app (i.e. https://demo.app/memes/doge ) */
  sourceUrl: string;
}
```

#### Mocking Data Using Faker

Now, let's mock search hit data based on this definition. I often use `faker` and `lodash.times` to generate mock data during development instead of using a pre-defined fixture to make things a bit more realistic. Don't forget to install @types/faker and @types/lodash.times for the type definitions if you want your IDE to help you out with autocompletion and whatnot.

Install faker & lodash.times with the following command:

```bash
yarn add -D faker@5.5.3 @types/faker@5.5.3 lodash.times @types/lodash.times
```

**IMPORTANT** Make sure to keep the faker@5.5.3 versionings because the author pulled a big petty and destroyed the versions after 5.5.3, so yeah.

For now, you can generate any number of mocks; I created a function `generateMockSearchResultDatas` that handles this for us:

```ts
export const generateMockSearchResultData = (index: number): SearchResultData => ({
  id: index,
  title: faker.lorem.words(3),
  sourceUrl: faker.lorem.slug()
});

export const generateMockSearchResultDatas = (n = 30) => times(n, generateMockSearchResultData);

export const mockSearchResultDatas = generateMockSearchResultDatas();
```

#### Rendering Array of Data in React

When mapping over an array to render elements in React, you must pass a key prop to each list item. Since our data model has a unique `id` property, we can use that for the key:

```tsx
<ul>
  {data.map((searchHit: SearchResultData) => (
    <li key={searchHit.id}>
      <a href={searchHit.sourceUrl}>{searchHit.title}</a>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

## ðŸŒ™ SearchModal: Updating Results Based On Query State

For the final step, we'll be implementing logic for updating the UI as soon as the query state changes and basic filtering of the data for a given query.

Let's define a function called getSearchResultsForQuery which will be passed a `query` string argument and return a `Promise` of an array of SearchResultData's, and implement it so that it filters the list of search hits for the given query string. I implemented a naive filtering algorithm for this to maintain focus in this blog post, but you can replace this logic with any logic you'd like.

## Conclusion

Feel free to look at my solution source code for inspiration for styling the React components. I left the explanations/snippets out for the styling portion of the tutorial because I wasn't sure people wanted to see it.

If you _do_ want to see explanations for how I went about the styling (or have any feedback/questions about this), please leave me a message or open an issue against the [Github repo](https://github.com/rasreee/cmdk-search-tutorial-skeleton).

Otherwise, thanks for reading my blog post!!!
